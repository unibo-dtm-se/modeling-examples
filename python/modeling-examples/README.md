# Calculator

A simple calculator GUI written in Python, based on [Kivy](https://kivy.org/).

## Remarks

UI code is indistinguishable from the business logic. 
This is a simple project, so it's not a big deal, but it's a bad practice in general. 

In a real project, one would separate the UI code from the business logic.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11
- Kivy 2.3

## How to run the app

Open a shell in this directory, and run the following command:

```bash
python calculator.py
```

> Recall restoring the dependencies before running the app for the first time.

## How to restore dependencies

Open a shell in this directory, and run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
